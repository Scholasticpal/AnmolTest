# Answer 1
## Front-end:

- User Interface: The front-end handles the presentation layer, including the design, layout, and user interactions.
- Technologies: It primarily utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface.
- Responsiveness: Ensures that the website is compatible with different devices and screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience.
- Examples: A front-end framework like React or Angular is used to build dynamic web applications. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon heavily rely on front-end technologies for their user interfaces.

## Back-end:

- Data Management: The back-end deals with data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, typically using databases.
- Server-side Logic: It handles business logic, user authentication, and data processing on the server.
- APIs: The back-end exposes APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow communication between the front-end and back-end systems.
- Examples: Popular back-end frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails power the server-side functionality of websites. Content management systems like WordPress and e-commerce platforms like Shopify have robust back-end systems.
- Overall, the front-end focuses on the user experience and interface, while the back-end manages the data and logic behind the scenes, ensuring the website functions smoothly. The front-end and back-end work together to deliver a complete web application or website.

Tags in HTML are markup elements used to define the structure and content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets and consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Here are the main categories of tags in HTML along with examples:

- Heading Tags: Used to define headings and subheadings.
Example: <h1>This is a Heading</h1>

- Paragraph Tags: Used to define paragraphs of text.
Example: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

- Link Tags: Used to create hyperlinks to other web pages.
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

- Image Tags: Used to display images on a web page.
Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Description">

- List Tags: Used to create ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted) lists.
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>

- Table Tags: Used to create tabular data.
Example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

- Form Tags: Used to create interactive forms for user input.
Example:
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

1. Initial Rendering: When a React component is first rendered, a virtual representation of the actual DOM is created in memory. This virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.

2. Virtual DOM Manipulation: Any updates or changes to the component are made on the virtual DOM instead of directly manipulating the real DOM. This makes the process faster and more efficient.

3. Diffing: After a change is made, React performs a process called "diffing" to identify the differences between the previous virtual DOM and the updated one. It determines the minimal number of changes needed to be made in the real DOM.

4. DOM Updates: Once the differences are calculated, React updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM, minimizing the number of DOM manipulations and improving performance.

5. Reconciliation: React reconciles the changes between the virtual DOM and the real DOM, ensuring that the two remain in sync. This process is optimized to minimize the impact on performance.

By using the Virtual DOM, React can efficiently manage and update the user interface, providing a smooth and responsive user experience while minimizing unnecessary DOM manipulations.

1. Data Model:
MySQL follows a structured, tabular data model where data is organized in tables with predefined schemas. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, employ flexible data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph models, allowing for dynamic and schema-less data storage. For example, in MySQL, you might have a "users" table with predefined columns like "name" and "email", while in a NoSQL database like MongoDB, each document in a "users" collection can have different fields and structures.

2. Scalability:
MySQL traditionally scales vertically, meaning it can handle increased workload by upgrading hardware resources. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing them to distribute data across multiple servers and handle high volumes of traffic by adding more servers to the cluster. This makes NoSQL databases more suitable for handling large-scale applications with high traffic loads.

3. Query Language:
MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to query and manipulate data. SQL provides a standardized language for interacting with relational databases. NoSQL databases often use their own query languages or APIs, which can vary based on the database type. For example, MongoDB uses the MongoDB Query Language (MQL) and Redis uses commands like SET and GET for data access.

4. Schema Flexibility:
MySQL requires predefined schemas, meaning the table structure and data types need to be determined before inserting data. NoSQL databases provide schema flexibility, allowing data to be inserted without a predefined structure. This enables agile development and easier handling of evolving data requirements.

5. ACID Compliance:
MySQL is ACID compliant, ensuring data consistency and integrity with features like transactions and strict data validation. NoSQL databases sacrifice some ACID properties for scalability and performance. They often prioritize availability and partition tolerance (AP) over consistency (CAP theorem). This trade-off allows for eventual consistency, where data updates may take time to propagate across the entire system.

# Answer 5

One widely used DBMS technology is MongoDB, which is a popular NoSQL document database. MongoDB is designed to store and retrieve data in the form of flexible, JSON-like documents, making it suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. Here's a brief explanation of MongoDB:

## MongoDB:
MongoDB is a document-oriented database that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance. It stores data in collections, which contain individual documents. Each document is a self-contained unit that can have its own unique structure, allowing for dynamic schemas.

Example:
Let's consider a blogging application where users can create and publish blog posts. In MongoDB, we can represent a blog post as a document within a "posts" collection. The document may have fields like "title," "content," "author," and "tags." However, different blog posts can have different fields, and additional fields can be added or modified as needed without affecting other documents.

{
"_id": ObjectId("123456789"),
"title": "Introduction to MongoDB",
"content": "MongoDB is a NoSQL document database...",
"author": "Anmol Garg",
"tags": ["MongoDB", "NoSQL", "Database"]
}

- In the above example, each field within the document represents a piece of information about the blog post. The "_id" field is automatically generated by MongoDB and serves as a unique identifier for the document.

- MongoDB provides a powerful query language and supports various operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), indexing, aggregation, and data replication. Its scalability is achieved through sharding, allowing the distribution of data across multiple servers.

- MongoDB is commonly used in applications that require flexibility in data modeling, real-time analytics, content management systems, and large-scale deployments handling high volumes of data.

Overall, MongoDB's document-based approach and rich features make it a popular choice for developers working with diverse and rapidly changing data structures.
